 Air levels Prediction Project
 Problem Statement
Air pollution affects people’s health and the environment.  
We want to predict air quality levelsusing weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Importance
This helps us know when air quality might be poor and supports better environmental planning.

 Dataset
We used the "Global Air Pollution Dataset (Kaggle)" which contains data on:
- Air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)  
- Weather data (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed)
